This project focuses on predicting three major health conditions—Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Kidney Disease—using supervised machine learning techniques. Leveraging structured medical datasets, the analysis aims to identify key risk indicators and build models capable of accurately classifying patient outcomes.Each dataset includes relevant clinical indicators such as glucose levels, blood pressure, age, BMI, creatinine, and cholesterol.
The workflow includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and standardizing numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding feature distributions, detect anomalies, and reveal correlations between key medical attributes. Categorical variables are encoded, numerical data standardized, and missing values handled appropriately.
- Modeling and Evaluation: Implementing multiple classifiers including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

  To perform classification, multiple supervised learning models were explored:
-  Logistic Regression — demonstrated consistently high accuracy and interpretability
-  Random Forest — provided robust performance across all three disease datasets with good generalization

Each disease module is trained and tested independently, with performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices guiding model selection.
Objective: Enable early detection and risk assessment for Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Kidney Disease by applying interpretable and scalable ML solutions.

- Developed an interactive user interface using Streamlit
- Allowed users to input patient parameters and receive disease predictions in real-time
- Incorporated model confidence scores and ROC visualizations for intuitive understanding
- Made it accessible for demonstration and health screening use cases via browser
